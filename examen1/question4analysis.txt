a)

the problem here looks to be the minimum amount of gifts we have to
move to organize them from the less valued to the best valued(1,2,....10)

b)
the subproblem is to know if the gift is on its place of the sequence:
where
a = gifts[i]
b = gifts[i + 1]
F(a,b) = b > a ? 1 + F(i + 1, i + 2) : F(i + 1, i + 2)

c)
the overlap occurs when we are asking every time we move through the list
