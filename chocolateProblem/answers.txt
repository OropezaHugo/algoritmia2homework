I applied a DP solution, so:
i) I analyzed the problem that a sub-problem
is that if we can add a new chocolate peace size which is different
of the added ones, until it stops to be possible we can take as many
peaces as pieces added we have.
ii) The overlaps occur when we can not add a peace unless it is not on the
already taken peaces list
iv) the implementation is O(n) because the only iteration depends on the
chocolate length

And finally I don't think that there is a way to use Greedy to solve the problem
because there is not a useful greedy choice to make
